# Matrix Effect

This is a Matrix-style text effect created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The effect consists of randomly generated characters from a set of letters, numbers, and symbols, which scroll vertically on a black background. The letters are colored in either green, red, or yellow, with a probability of 5% for each color. The script updates the matrix every 50ms, creating a continuous flow of scrolling text. The effect is contained within a '<pre>' tag and styled using CSS to cover the entire viewport. The code can be found in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and can be used as-is by running the index.html file.
